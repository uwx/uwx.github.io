# Maxine ([@uwx](https://github.com/uwx)) ![banner for me](/uwx.png)

I'm a backend C# and Java developer and frontend JavaScript / TypeScript + Solid,
Svelte, Vue, and Angular.

I also like reverse engineering, network security and optimizing compilers, and I
also speak Python, Lua, Ruby, Vala, and a little Rust.
