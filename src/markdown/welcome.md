# Maxine ([@uwx](https://github.com/uwx))

I'm a backend C# and Java developer and frontend JavaScript / TypeScript + Solid,
Svelte, Vue, and Angular.

I also like reverse engineering, network security and optimizing compilers, and I
also speak Python, Lua, Ruby, Vala, and a little Rust.

### Here are some of my things:

habits.*
